# bankist-app-tutorial-example

A modern, minimalistic banking interface originally created by Jonas Schmedtmann in his JavaScript course and recoded by me to deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation, events, arrays, dates, timers, and clean JavaScript architecture.

This project simulates basic banking operations such as transferring money, requesting loans, and viewing transaction history — all using pure JavaScript.
